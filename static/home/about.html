            <p>CruiseBlog is a blog dedicated exclusively to guests aboard the Holland America <em>Zuiderdam</em>.
                Only people connected to this ship’s Wi-Fi can access it.
                All posts are completely anonymous and local to this cruise.</p>
            <p>This project is being built as part of my master’s degree program, so your participation is genuinely appreciated.
                Feel free to share thoughts, questions, stories, observations, or anything else that comes to mind during the voyage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Comments, concerns, and questions can all be submitted as blog posts.
                I’ll do my best to read and respond when I can.</p>
            <p>Thanks for being part of the experiment — and enjoy the cruise!</p>
